-> Task 1 

Add Auto-Slide Feature with Click Navigation
Enhance the Carousel component by implementing an auto-slide feature that automatically 
transitions to the next image every 1 second. 
The transition should be smooth and continuous while looping back to the first image after reaching the last one.
In addition to the automatic sliding, the carousel should also allow manual navigation — 
meaning the user can click on navigation dots (or any other clickable element) to jump to a specific slide at any time.
When a user manually changes the slide, the auto-slide interval should continue running normally without interruption 
or restarting the timer.


-> Task 2

Add Start and Stop buttons in the parent component of the carousel.
These buttons should allow the parent to control the slideshow 
for example,
clicking Start should begin the automatic image rotation, and clicking Stop should pause it.
The goal is to ensure that the carousel’s playback behavior can be managed EXTERNALLY 
rather than only within the component itself.
